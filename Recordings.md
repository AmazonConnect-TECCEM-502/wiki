# Recordings (About)

Recordings is the area of the project where the application generates an mp4 file 
of a recording, which contains:

• Agent screen video
• Agent and customer audio
• Agent keystrokes
• Call Rating
• Video category

Which are processed and stored in the database with their specific categories,
with the relevant information for their classification, with the purpose of 
reproducing them in the same app, for their future for the internal agents of 
the organization in case of be necessary.

## Few Notes Before Start

This application was divided into various repositories in order to generate the 
functionalities of each area in a more orderly, clean and concise way, as well
as to have order in the code sections that will be presented later.
