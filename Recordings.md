# Recordings

Recordings is the area of the project where the application generates an mp4 file 
of a recording, which contains:

1. Agent Screen Video.
2. Agent and Customer Audio.
3. Agent Keystrokes.
4. Call Rating.
5. Transcript (subtitles) of the Video.

the organization in case of be necessary.

## Few Notes Before Start

This application was divided into various repositories in order to generate the 
functionalities of each area in a more orderly, clean and concise way, as well
as to have order in the code sections that will be presented on this wiki.

# 

## Getting Started

In order to use the Recordings sections available in the repositories, 
you must download and use the following libraries and configurations in 
order to correctly use the functionality of the area.

## FrontEnd

#### React

The `react` package contains only the functionality necessary to define
React components. It is typically used together with a React renderer 
like react-dom for the web, or react-native for the native environments.

`npm install react`

or:

`yarn add react`

#### React-Media-Recorder

`React-media-recorder` is a fully typed react component with render prop, 
or a react hook, that can be used to:

• Record audio/video

• Record screen


`npm i react-media-recorder`

or:

`yarn add react-media-recorder`

#### React-Icons

Include popular icons in your React projects easily with `react-icons`, 
which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that your project is using.

`npm install react-icons --save`

or:

`yarn add react-icons`

#### Axios

Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

`npm install axios`

or:

`yarn add axios`
